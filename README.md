# Project 4: Around The U.S

## '''Basic JavaScript - Practicum100'''
### Micky Rashty

#### Project Description

This project is the first project of the Basic JavaScript course at Practicum100. 
I built a *single web-page* that contains a profile info (incl. picture, name & about sections), Edit & Add buttons, and image grid.
In this project I used different technologies and for the first time used JavaScript to control elements behaviour. 

#### Project Description

some of the techniques and the technologies I used are:
* Flexbox
* Grid
* Positioning
* Font import
* Font smoothing for chrome and firefox
* BEM nested file structure
* JavaScript

and more... :-)
